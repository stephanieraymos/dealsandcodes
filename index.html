	<!--Different deal types -->

	<h2 class="heading">Different types of deals:</h2>

	<img class="arrows" src="images/arrows.png" alt="image of arrows pointing down">
		

	</p>

	<h3 class="typestop">PRICE DROPS</h3>
		<p>A price drop is when an item has dropped in price from it's original cost.</p>
		<img class="center" src="images/pricedrop.png" alt="price drop example">

	<h3 class="types">ADD ON ITEMS</h3>
		<p>An add on item is an item on amazon that ships when you have a cart subtotal of $25.00 or higher. You can read about some ways around the minimum threshold requirements <a href="add-on.html" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

	<h3 class="types">PROMO CODES</h3>
		<p>Some of our deals require a promo code to get the discounted price.</p>
		<p>The multi use codes can be used by everyone and are 8 digits long like this: KEI4HSA9. These codes can only be used one time on each amazon account. If a deal includes multiple items that you want but the deal only has one code; you must add all the items to your cart and purchase in one transaction since the code will only apply to your account one time.</p>
		<p>The single use codes can only be used one time by one person and are then invalid after the first use. These codes are 16 digits long with dashes in between like this: HSKE-AKO7-EK3KD-46KT. These codes will be dispersed using a "get code" button. Please do not press the button if you do not plan to use the code because once the server dispenses each code, it erases it from the database of unused codes that are given out to others that want them.</p>
		<p>Promo codes are entered in the promo code field on the checkout screen.</p>
		<img class="center" src="images/promo-code-field.png" alt="promo code field example image">

	<h3 class="types">COUPONS</h3>
		<p>Coupons are either dollar amounts or percentages that come off when you clip them. Depending on what device you're using, (phone, PC or tablet;) you will either see a box to check, or a solid green bar with the discount to click on.</p>
		<img class="center" src="images/couponclip2.jpg" alt="clippable coupon checkbox image">
		<img class="center" src="images/coupon-clip2.png" alt="clippable coupon button image">

		<h3 class="types">PROMOS STACKING</h3>
		<p>When a deal breakdown mentions multiple promo attributes such as: coupon and code; it means there are several factors working in combination to bring down the price of the item.</p>
		<p> For example; If a box of tissue costs $2.00 and has a coupon taking off $0.50 cents and a promo code taking off $1.00; the item will end up costing $0.50 cents after both the coupon and code discounts are applied. Not all coupons/codes stack together but when they do we will specify in the deal breakdown. Other examples of factors that can occasionally combine are lightening deals, automatic discounts and subscribe and save offers.</p>

	<h3 class="types">LIGHTENING DEALS</h3>
		<p>Lightening deals are limited time discounts that are also limited by "spots." If all available spots are claimed before the time allotted is up, you can join the waitlist until it becomes full.</p>
		<img class="center" src="images/lightening-deal.png" alt="lightning deal example">

	<h3 class="types">SUBSCRIBE AND SAVE</h3>
		<p>Amazon offers subscribe and save discounts for certain items. You will get an extra 5% off of the item when you checkout via subscribe and save. If you're subscribed to 5 or more items you will get 15% off. Subscriptions can be cancelled after the order has shipped. I like to stay subscribed to at least 5 items at once to receive the 15% discount. You can go into your subscriptions and edit the delivery dates for future subscriptions or change the frequency of shipments. I set all my subscriptions to ship "once every 6 months" in case I forget for awhile to go edit my deliveries. Some items; such as diapers, offer 20% savings with 5 or more subscriptions!</p>

	<!--Error Messages-->

	<h2 class="heading">ERROR MESSAGES</h2>

<div class="invisible-border">
	<p><h3>There are 8 different error messages that you might see at some point after entering a promotional code. They all mean something different. All error messages and their meanings are below.</h3></p>
</div>

	<img class="arrows" src="images/arrows.png" alt="image of arrows pointing down">

	<h4 class="messagestop">"The promotional code you entered cannot be applied to your purchase."</h4>


	<img class="center" src="images/cannot-be-applied.png" alt="cannot be applied error message view">

<div class="invisible-border">
		<p class="errorlist">-Check to see that you are buying from the right seller. Some of the sellers ship the item from their warehouse and the default is FBA shipment. Choose a different seller under "other sellers on amazon."</p>
</div>
		<p><img class="center"  src="images/buying-options.png" alt="other buying options view"></p>
<div class="invisible-border">
		<p class="errorlist">-You may have purchased from this seller before with a code. Amazon limits accounts to one code per account per code sequence.</p>

		<p class="errorlist">-The code may only apply to certain colors or options. Usually we will specify in our deal breakdown if a code has limitations.</p>
</div>
		<p><img class="center" src="images/mutiple-options.png" alt="multiple selections of a product"></p>
<div class="invisible-border">
		<p class="errorlist">-In rare occasions this message can be a glitch and means the discount already applied to your account. Refresh your cart and view your total at checkout.</p>

</div>


	<h4 class="messages">"The promotional code you entered has expired."</h4>
<div class="invisible-border">
	<img class="center" src="images/expired.png" alt="expired promo code view">


		<p class="errorlist">-This message means that the seller deactivate the coupons from Amazon and there is no way to claim them. In this case there will most likely be no new codes available.</p>

</div>


	<h4 class="messages">“This Promotion has not yet begun”</h4>
<div class="invisible-border">

		<p class="errorlist">-Every Promotion on Amazon has its own start date and hour. Even when the seller creates the promotion and see's that it has been activated, it takes 4 hours for the promotion to become active. If you get the message that the promotion has not yet begun, wait 4 hours and try again.</p>

</div>


	<h4 class="messages"> "The promotional code you entered is not valid”</h4>

	<img class="center" src="images/not-valid.png" alt="not valid promo code view">

<div class="invisible-border">
		<p class="errorlist">-This message means the seller disabled the code, or the offer hasn't started yet.</p>
		<p class="errorlist">-For single use codes; this message could also mean that the code was alraedy used by another account other than yours.</p>

</div>
	<h4 class="messages">“This Promotional Code has already been redeemed”</h4>
	<h4 class="messages">"The gift card or promotional code has already been applied to your account balance."</h4>

	<img class="center" src="images/already-applied.png" alt="already applied to your balance image">
<div class="invisible-border">
		<p class="errorlist">-These two messages means the discount has applied to your account and your discount will be reflected at checkout. The most common reason for these messages is when an item has an "auto discount" that applies to your cart without a code. When the code is entered it lets you know that the discount has already been redeemed. See your total at checkout.</p>
</div>
	<h4 class="messages">"We're unable to save your gift card or promotional code information. Please enter it again or try using another form of payment"</h4>

<div class="invisible-border">
		<p class="errorlist">-This means your discount applied, but the server thinks you're trying to enter a gift card number instead. Refresh and see total at checkout, your discount should be taken off.</p>
