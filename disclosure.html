	<p>To be in compliance with the new FTC ruling, here is my complete disclosure on sponsorships and paid advertising on Deals and Codes CommunityÂ®</p>

	<p>For questions about this website, please contact Stephanie Raymos directly at dealsandcodescommunity@gmail.com</p>


<h2 class="hborder">The basics</h2>

<p>Basically, this website/app takes up lots of our time. All the site editing and ideas take hours of preparation and editing for each part, and searching for deals and then posting them is in addition to that. So to justify our time spent here, we do accept several forms of paid advertising and sponsorships. With that said, we do closely screen the businesses/sellers that we allow on our website and only accept advertisers that we believe to be a good fit for Deals and Codes Community and worthy of your time.</p>

<p>This website is solely created and edited by, Stephanie Raymos.</p>
<p>Other individuals mentioned above add content to the site in the form of deal posts.</p>
