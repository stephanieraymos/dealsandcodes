	<h1 class="hborder">Bypassing Add-on Requirements</h1>

<p>There are several ways to purchase an "add on item" without needing to meet the minimum $25.00 threshold.</p>

<h3 class="hborder">Your amazon delivery day</h3>

<p>Some accounts offer a special feature for members to set up "your amazon delivery day" as a shipment option. If you're one of the lucky members with this feature; you can purchase add on items by themselves when you select your pre-specified day at checkout. </p>

<h3 class="hborder">Alexa</h3>

<p>If you have an amazon alexa device, you can ask her to order the specific item and she will usually get the job done. Be specific when asking her to purchase the item you want so she finds the one you're looking for. For example; if you want to buy this add on item:</p>
<img src="images/coldcalm.png" alt="coldcalm product image">
<p>You would tell Alexa: Purchase "Boiron Coldcalm 60 tablets homeopathic medicine for cold relief" to make sure she finds the correct product. She'll ask you a few questions to confirm and all you have to do is say "yes."</p>

<h3 class="hborder">Code trick</h3>

<p>The $25.00 minimum threshold refers to your subtotal . So if you have a $20.00 item with a code that makes it $5.00, and an add on item that costs $5.00; your subtotal before discount is $25.00 so you will be able to checkout.</p>
